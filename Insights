From the Titanic dataset, 
Correlation insights -

Survived vs Sex → not directly here (Sex is categorical), but encoded version shows strong correlation (females survived more).
Survived vs Pclass → negative correlation (~ –0.34) → higher class passengers had better survival.
Survived vs Fare → positive correlation (~ 0.26) → wealthier passengers survived more.
Pclass vs Fare → strong negative correlation (~ –0.55) → higher class tickets had higher fares.
SibSp vs Parch → weak positive correlation (~ 0.41) → families tended to travel together
Age → very weak correlation with survival (children slightly better chance

More OBSERVATION -

Survival Count → ~62% did not survive, 38% survived.
Sex vs Survival → Females survived more (classic "women and children first").
Pclass vs Survival → 1st class had highest survival, 3rd class lowest.
Age Distribution → Most passengers were 20–40 years old.
Boxplot Age vs Pclass → 1st class had older passengers.
Heatmap → Fare and Pclass strongly linked to survival chances.

SUMMARY - 

Titanic survival was strongly influenced by Gender (females survived more).
Passenger Class mattered: 1st class > 2nd class > 3rd class.
Fare (proxy for wealth) correlated positively with survival.
Age showed children (lower age) had relatively higher survival than adults.

The dataset contains missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked) that must be handled before ML.
